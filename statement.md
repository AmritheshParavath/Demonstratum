# Playing the Game

## Launching

Launch like any other app. **However, be sure to set the resolution to 1024x768 (or something close to it) in the launcher.** It may look stretched, but that's what the visual effect was coded to work with. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Controls

w, a, s, d -> Move

mouse -> Look

tab -> Enter speech mode

(In speech mode)

click -> make sound

release -> lock in note

r -> undo note

## Instructions

Try to emulate all 4 chords spoken by the Teacher (blue light). To  do this, you will need to enter speech mode (press tab) and make **3 guesses** (click on the disk 3 in 3 places). Once 3 guesses are made, you will play the chord of all 3 put together. 

Avoid being seen by *all* humans; they will try to kill you. If you are seen, run; you can lose them. Any health you lose will regenerate after a short time.
