Demonstratum is the most pretentious-sounding title I could come up witih on short notice to encapsulate this video game adaptation of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*. Conveniently, the term is also wildly apropos, evoking the antiquity of the setting, containing one of the many epithets of Frankenstein's monster, and being the latin for "that which was proven" and "that which was shown." Indeed, demonstrating is the central premise of the game. Your goal, upon waking up within the body of the demon, looking through its primitive eyes at an alien world, is first to run and then to learn, and you do this by imitation. Just as the monster learns by watching Felix teach Safie from afar, you learn by 

Of course, just as Shelley livens up the monster's year long education with a brisk and sentimental montage, I have to spice up 
Unfortunately, games don't lend themselves as easily to montage. Continuity between actions and participating in extended procedure is what the medium excels at. So, rather than   

The procedure of learning itself—
was modeled loosely after machine learning. The directional indicators you see after producing an incorrect chord  function something like gradient descent, the algorithm used by neural networks to slowly, but intelligently tune their parameters. Critically, this fairly rote, mechanical feature is intertwined with Felix and Safie: the closer you are to them, the more accurate the indicators will be. 

I chose the sound
Your wobbly theremin-like voice was 

Aesthetics are often a siren song for me, luring me away from designing critical game functions, but in this instance, I can't say the distraction wasn't fruitful. 

The largely abstract environment 
To Shelley's monster, the world is as strange as Shelley writes it, but to a player attempting to inhabit

As this is a prototype, there were numerous features I couldn't even get to, but they're worth mentioning. Were I to elaboorate further, I would want to evolve the language learning 
Primarily, I would focus on providing actual uses for the chords that you learn
Once a "day" of learning has been completed, I'd want the player to have the chance to explore nature like the monster did in *Frankenstein*, and using their newfound speaking skills, they could commune with nature—stuff like make plants grow with their voice or unlocking different parts of the woods. Beyond that, I would build out the speech system. Upon learning a chord, it would be saved in an interface on the opposite side of the screen. The player could then build music (the metaphorical equivalent of sentences), and use the songs to further harmonize with nature, or possibly speak with the humans in the end and give the monster the happy ending he always deserved.
